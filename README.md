# Stanford-RNA-3D-Folding-Part2-Baseline
This project presents a baseline deep learning approach for the Stanford RNA 3D Folding problem. The goal is to predict RNA tertiary structure using only nucleotide sequence information. It serves as a reference implementation for benchmarking advanced architectures and future improvements.
