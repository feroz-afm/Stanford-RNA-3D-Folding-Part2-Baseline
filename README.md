This project presents a baseline deep learning approach for the Stanford RNA 3D Folding problem. The goal is to predict RNA tertiary structure using only nucleotide sequence information. It serves as a reference implementation for benchmarking advanced architectures and future improvements.


# Stanford RNA 3D Folding – Part 2 (Baseline)

This repository contains a baseline implementation for the **Stanford RNA 3D Folding** problem, focusing on predicting RNA tertiary structure from sequence information.

##  Overview
Predicting RNA 3D structure is a challenging task that relies on identifying spatial patterns using only nucleotide sequences. In this notebook, a **baseline deep learning approach** is implemented to establish a reference performance for further experimentation and improvements.

##  Dataset
